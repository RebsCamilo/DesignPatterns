/*
Observer lets you define a subscription mechanism to notify
multiple objects about any events that happen to the object
theyâ€™re observing.
An Observer Pattern says that "just define a one-to-one
dependency so that when one object changes state, all its
dependents are notified and updated automatically".
It is also known as Dependents or Publish-Subscribe.
